# Introduction
This project acts as coursework for the Visual Analytics module of the MSc Data Science course at City, University of London. The key elements of the coursework were to:
1. Find 2-3 papers published in respected journals or conferences that deal with similar data and problems and apply visualisations for solving the problems
2. Describe in more detail the dataset(s) you are using. How were the data collected? Describe the structure, i.e., the fields, their meanings, types of the values. 
3.  Describe the process of your analysis, in which you apply the approach presented in the previous subsection. Give particular attention to the human side of the process, including interpretation of information displays, reasoning about what is seen, making decision concerning the ways to proceed with the analysis, and drawing conclusions that answer the questions of your study.
